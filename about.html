      <h4>INTRO</h4>
      <p class="p1">
        I am the VP of Engineering at Smile Identity, where I work on tools that
        have helped over 90 million people in Africa gain access to financial
        services. Before Smile, I was the co-founder & CTO of
        <a href="https://arthena.com/">Arthena</a> and a co-founder of
        <a href="https://matroid.com/">Matroid</a>. In my spare time, I enjoy
        investing in people and ideas through a
        <a href="https://skepticalinvestments.biz/">small venture fund</a>. I am
        particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you
        think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet,
        please feel free to get in touch.

      <h4>SOME HISTORY</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was
          an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2,
          Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a
          turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo
          button really did.
        </li>
        <li>
          We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a
          floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to
          send my first email.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased MegaRace from Media Play and
          installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her
          business by using her computer too much.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also
          beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after
          I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a
          floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works.
          I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800,
          and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our
          Pentium III Gateway. My website was terrible.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was 11 when I built my first Tesla Coil (without the permission of
          my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including
          one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag
          facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon
          protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of
          patience. I was unstoppable.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more
          times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped
          build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two
          more.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high
          school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members
          about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet
          firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work
          months later.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund,
          Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.
        </li>
        <li>
          14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included
          Counter-Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of
          Empires II.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 18, in the summer before college, my friends and I started playing
          Muggle Quidditch. We went on to start over 8 teams in the
          International Quidditch Association, including the Buffalo Quidditch
          Society. At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I
          don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom
          while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on Facebook.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic
          paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+
          person team for the next two years. You can read more about that here.
